When I was still working in academia I was looking for a way to send my R or
Julia code from [Atom](https://atom.io) to the REPL running in Terminal.app or
iTerm. Writing my first package for a then new text editor and learning
CoffeeScript along the way seemed like a fun challenge.

REPL Term has support for Julia, R, Python and NodeJS. Given my current job
profile, I don't use it anymore, and hence development has kind of stalled. But
I keep promising myself to keep working on it. Check out the Github repository
for more information.
