At some point when moving a project over to [webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
for module bundling, my team was facing the issue of how to dynamically inline
static assets. Specfically, we wanted to inline [SVG sprites](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/) on pages that required them.

I wrote the [inline-loader](https://github.com/felixjung/inline-loader) scratch that itch. Find out more on Github.
