Apple [has announced](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2016/) their next
media event with the teaser line *Let us loop you in* for March, 21st.
According to Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac we can expect a new 4" [iPhone
SE](http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/26/apple-iphone-se-4-inch-2016/), a [9.7" iPad
Pro](http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/25/smaller-ipad-pro-march/), and probably some
new [Apple Watch
bands](http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/02/march-15-event-4-inch-phone-new-ipad-apple-watch/).
That new iPad Pro got me thinking about Apple's broader plans for the iPad and Macbook ecosystem.<!--more-->

Before the fall of 2015, Apple was no longer selling a laptop under the *Macbook* brand, i.e. no Air or Pro additions to the name. The Macbook Air was introduced as a new kind of ultra protable laptop. Over time it took the place of the original Macbook in the company's lineup. The Air offered the same level of performance in a lighter package at a price point similar to the Macbook, making the former redundant. Apple took the logical step and discontinued the Macbook. But what was going to happen to that classic brand name?

Late last year Apple answered that question by introducing the all new Macbook with retina display. At 2.03 pounds the 12" laptop is even lighter than the 11" Macbook Air, coming in at 2.38 punds. With the retina display it's display is clearly superior, too. But of course there are things like performance and the fact that the Macbook comes with only a single USB-C port.
