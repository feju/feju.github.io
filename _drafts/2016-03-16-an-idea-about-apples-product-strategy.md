Apple [has announced](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2016/) their next
media event with the teaser line *Let us loop you in* for March, 21st. According
to Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac we can expect
a new 4" [iPhone
SE](http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/26/apple-iphone-se-4-inch-2016/), a [9.7" iPad
Pro](http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/25/smaller-ipad-pro-march/), and probably some
new [Apple Watch
bands](http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/02/march-15-event-4-inch-phone-new-ipad-apple-watch/).
Like many other people, I am curious about the role of the rumored iPad Pro.
