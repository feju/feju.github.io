Apple [has announced](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2016/) their next
media event with the teaser line *Let us loop you in* for March, 21st.
According to Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac we can expect a new 4" [iPhone
SE](http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/26/apple-iphone-se-4-inch-2016/), a [9.7" iPad
Pro](http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/25/smaller-ipad-pro-march/), and probably some
new [Apple Watch
bands](http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/02/march-15-event-4-inch-phone-new-ipad-apple-watch/).
That new iPad Pro got me thinking about Apple's broader plans for the iPad and
Macbook product lines.<!--more-->

I expect Apple to eliminate the Macbook Air and iPad Air from their lineup over
this and next year. Instead, they will offer a Macbook and a Macbook Pro in the
laptop and an iPad and an iPad Pro in the tablet category. The pro products
will be available in two screen sizes and offer better performance paired with
"professional features". The current 12.9" iPad Pro gives an indication as to
what could remain pro features for a 9.7" version:

* Smart connector for attaching keyboard accessories
* Four-speaker design
* Advanced storage controller for better memory performance
* Apple Pencil support

##### Cleaning up the product lines

Why do I think Apple is going to do this? Think about it, the Macbook Air was a
radical machine when it was first introduced. No other laptop was as thin, and
owning the first generation Macbook Air cost a premium. Over time this changed
and the Air became Apple's default consumer laptop. Last year, the company
introduced a new 12" Macbook that is lighter and thinner than the 11" Macbook
Air. I am convinced the only reason Apple kept the Air around was that the
Macbook was too much of a compromise in terms of performance and connectivity
and too expensive at the time. Just like the original Air, it was too much of a
technological advancement for the broader market. That could very well change
this year -- rendering the Macbook Air obsolete.

The case for dropping the iPad Air is similar. It was introduced at a time when
the iPad 2 was still being sold as a cheap entry device. The iPad Air was also
a lot lighter and thinner than any other existing iPad. It made sense to give
it a more distinct name. Maybe Apple even wanted to associate it with the
Macbook Air. In any case, Apple is no longer selling the iPad 2. Their iPad
lineup consists of the current iPad Pro, the iPad Air 2 and iPad Air, and two
generations of iPad Minis. The Air suffix no longer provides any additional
distinction and being *as thin as Air* is the new default.

I do not know when the Air products are going to be phased out. If I would have
to bet, then Apple is going to introduce new Macbook Pros with the same color
options and probably a new design at WWDC in June. The new consumer iPad could be
introduced in the Fall, with the iPad Air 2 taking the place of the entry level
device[^1]. I would expect a new Macbook at screen sizes different than 12" around
Fall as well.

##### Long-term outcome

What that would leave us with is a clean lineup for Mac laptops and iPads. All
machines come with Retina screens and there are distinct products for consumers
and professionals. All come in the same three color options of silver, black,
and gold. Having a dedicated iPad line for professional use -- that is more
than a single device -- could also help Apple establish iPads as serious
creation devices, something that has been difficult in the past.

[^1]: Yes, that means at least one more year of iPad Air.
