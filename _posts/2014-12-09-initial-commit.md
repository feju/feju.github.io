Hi, I'm Felix. Welcome to my blog *Almost Surely* on [felixjung.io](http://felixjung.io). I have built this page to familiarize myself with modern web technologies[^1], write about my research[^2], write about and publish some development projects I might be working on, and finally to have an outlet for my thoughts on topics like [Apple Inc.](http://apple.com), technology culture, and [film](http://letterboxd.com/feju/). Read on to find out what plans I have for this site.<!--more-->

##### Further Development
I decided to ship this webpage at a very unpolished stage. Otherwise I would have ended up adding improvements and features to the site without ever getting anything published. For the near future I still have plenty of ideas:

1. Quantified self section on about page
    * Requires backend API written in [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
    * Will display data from [Withings](http://www.withings.com/) and other data providers
2. Integration of my [500px](https://500px.com/felixjung) stream on the about page in a nice responsive and touch-enabled carousel
3. Blog post categories and tags on a single page
4. Search functionality
5. Some nicer animations

##### Blog Posts
My previous attempts at starting blogs have all failed miserably. I never actually wrote any posts. This time I'm determined to write a post at least every two weeks. These are some ideas I have:

1. Parallel computation in [Julia](http://julialang.org)
2. Implementing an optimization problem using the [MathProgBase.jl package](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathProgBase.jl) for Julia
3. Setting up Apple's Family Sharing feature in iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite to *finally* merge Apple IDs used on iTunes and/or the App Store


##### Further Content
To give research and development projects of mine more exposure I'm going to introduce two additional pages. Research projects should feature nice interactive plots and code examples as well as links to the corresponding working papers.

I hope some people will find useful information and content on *Almost Surely*. Let me know what you think.

Felix
