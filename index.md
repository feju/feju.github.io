Hi, my name is Felix Jung. I have the privilege of writing code for a living --
 mostly JavaScript. In 2015 I joined [SumUp](https://sumup.com), where I am part
 of the web frontend team.

 Check out my online presences below for blog posts, code samples, and other
 activities. If you would like to get in touch, Twitter is a good place.
