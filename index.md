Hi, my name is Felix Jung. I have the privilege of writing code for a living --
 mostly JavaScript. In 2015 I joined [SumUp](https://sumup.com), where I am part
 of the web frontend team.

 Check out my Github profile, blog on Medium, Twitter account, or Instagram feed
 below to see what I'm up to.
 
 If you would like to get in touch, send me a tweet or a good old
 [ðŸ“¨](mailto:jung.felix@gmail.com).
