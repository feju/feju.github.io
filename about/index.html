      <p>Hello, my name is Felix and I greatly enjoy being a web front-end engineer at <a href="https://sumup.de" target="_blank">SumUp</a> in Berlin. In a previous life I thought I was going to work in quantitative finance.</p>
      <p>Most of my development time is spent writing Javascript with AngularJS. I try to pursue interesting side projects as much as possible. You can find them on the projects page. It would be great to do some larger projects in node JS and pick up iOS and Mac development at some point.</p>
      <p>I spend maybe too much time following Apple and other tech companies. But what can I do. I got my first iPod nano for Christmas in 2005 and by now I bleed six colours.</p>
      <p>Originally, I built this page to get back into web development. Now, I'm looking to use it to write about interesting problems I stumble upon as a web developer.</p>
      <p>You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/feju">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/felixjung">Github</a>.</p>
